# DataFlow

A web application built using Spring boot to migrate data between repositories. Currently, the application can do bulk transfer of records between tables from on-premise MySQL, Amazon RDS for MySQl and BigQuery.

Functionality to implement Change Data Capture (CDC) is in development stage. Once the development for CDC is complete any data changes in source repository can be relayed to the destination repo in real-time.
